# SeamonstersCodeSlideshow
A nice-looking code display specifically designed for the Seamonsters team competition code.

There are prebuilt versions for Windows, in the directories that start with `application.`. For the 32-bit Windows version, you will need Java.

When the program starts it will ask for a program directory. The directory, and its subdirectories, will be searched for `.py` files. It will also ask for a message to display at the top of the screen.

If you want to build it yourself or modify the code, you will need [Processing 3](processing.org).
