# SeamonstersCodeSlideshow
A nice-looking code display specifically designed for the Seamonsters team
competition code. It requires [Processing 3](processing.org).

When the program starts it will ask for a program directory. The directory, and
its subdirectories, will be searched for `.py` files. It will also ask for a
message to display at the top of the screen.
