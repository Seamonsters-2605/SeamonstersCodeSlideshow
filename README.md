# SeamonstersCodeSlideshow
A nice-looking code display specifically designed for the Seamonsters team competition code.

There are prebuilt versions for Windows [here](https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/SeamonstersCodeSlideshow/releases). For the 32-bit version, you will need Java.

When the program starts it will ask for a program directory (the dialog box might be hidden behind other windows). The directory, and its subdirectories, will be searched for `.py` files. It will also ask for a message to display at the top of the screen.

If you want to build it yourself or modify the code, you will need [Processing 3](processing.org).

If you have problems, try disabling OpenGL by setting the `useOpenGL` flag near the top to `false`.
